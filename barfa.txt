You must have noticed that till now we have been learning one new concept per tutorial.
For some important concepts like loops we had to allocate two tutorials so we can grasp the concept of both loops (for and while) separately.
But now in the case of the file, we have allocated the next five tutorials (excluding the exercise and their solutions).
So, from this, you can take a hint that how important file handling is in programming.
